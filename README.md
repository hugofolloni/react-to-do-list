# react-to-do-list

A simple to-do list made with React. That is my first real project using that library and I learned so much doing it. It is a to-do list with a pomodoro timer integrated, where the user can control his tasks and time for study/work. Since I don't have any design skills, the UI is really bad, but the tecnologies are kinda great haha. The user current and pasts tasks are storage on a json file, also with the last pomodoros linked with their respective task. The user have full access to json file data.

The other light pages follows the same idea that the dark ones, just with light colors (obviously hahaha).
