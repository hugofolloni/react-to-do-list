# react-to-do-list

A simple to-do list made with React. That is my first real project using that library and I learned so much doing it. It is a to-do list with a pomodoro timer integrated, where the user can control his tasks and time for study/work. Since I don't have any design skills, the UI is really bad, but the tecnologies are kinda great haha. The user current and pasts tasks are storage on a json file, also with the last pomodoros linked with their respective task. The user have full access to json file data.
